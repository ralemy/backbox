# xamarin-specflow-mvvm
Boilerplate code to develop an MVVM app on Xamarin and test it with Specflow and Xamarin.UITest

## User Story: 

*As a* Mobile App developer

*I want* to have a boilerplate example of using BDD and MVVM-Light in Xamarin framework

*So that* I can develop multiplatform apps that use the BDD technique for testing and MVVM-light for component management.

## Restrictions and Requirements (MoSCoW method)
-	The boilerplate project MUST show how to use Visual Studio to set up the app codebase
-	The boilerplate project MUST show how to add Specflow for BDD support to the app codebase
-	The boilerplate project MUST show how to write Specflow steps in Xamarin.UITest framework
-	The boilerplate project MUST show how to add pages and components using MVVM-Light framework
## Acceptance Tests

*Given*: The repo is cloned

*When*: I read the documentation included

*Then*: I have a step by step explanation on how to setup and develop Xamarin apps using Specflow and MVVM.
